# MLH-MIMIC-IV
***State of the work: IN PROGRESS***
Repository for MLH final project. 
The setup.py is the executable of the application . The application works in windows x64 installing streamlit as a main dependency of the project.
The instructions to execute the application are the following ones:
1. Download the files with git clone command and save in the path you want.
2. Open your terminal and run setup.py with command line "python setup.py"
3. The application perhaps will ask for if you are the administrator or not. Please put 1 and in case the program
   does noot ask you this, pass to the following instruction
4. Once done this you have to stablish the path were activate.bat of anaconda is located:
 Example:  C:/Users/nameofadmin/anaconda3/Scripts/activate.bat
5. Another thing is locating the conda environment you are using. It is needed to take the name were you have installed all your dependencies
 Example: "base" is the default name of a conda environment, but maybe you can use another environment you have already set on your conda app.
6. Once done this if all is right, the app must run at streamlit localhost.
7. Lastly, if you want to ***cancel out the program you must prest Control+C keyborads in command line to exit the app web.***
